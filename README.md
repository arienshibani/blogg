# The Nice Blog ðŸŒ­

My SvelteKit-powered blog that uses GitHub Issues as a CMS.


## Why is this interesting? ðŸ¤”

Instead of relying on a traditional CMS (content management system), this blog leverages GitHub Issues for content management. Benefits include: 

* Simple & Lightweight â€“ No need for a database or a heavy CMS, just GitHub!

* Built-in Collaboration â€“ Readers can comment, react, or even suggest edits directly via GitHub Issues.

* Version Control â€“ Every post is automatically tracked with Git, allowing easy edits and history tracking.

* Free Hosting â€“ The blog can be hosted for free on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
